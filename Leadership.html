            <h2>Leadership</h2>
            <p>During Team and subsequent weeks, I stepped into the role of Client Liason/Project Lead, ensuring tasks were completed on time and everyone felt heard. My Gifts Project revealed strengths in creative Thinking, Communication, and Problem-Solving â€” all of which I applied during projects and community roles. Hosting Tea Guests taught me the art of meaningful conversation and connection, while my Dream Speech allowed me to be recognized as a civic leader.</p>
