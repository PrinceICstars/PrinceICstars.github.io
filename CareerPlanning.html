            <h2>Career Planning</h2>
            <p>I came into i.c.stars with curiosity, ambition, and a desire to build a career in technology, but without a clear roadmap. Before the program, I knew I wanted to work in tech, but I wasnt sure how to connect my problem-solving skills, creativity, and leadership potential into a long-term professional journey.
Through the program, I have not only learned technical skills but also discovered more about myself as a leader and professional. Working closely with the Career Development Director and Program Manager, I have been able to refine my resume, practice telling my story, and develop confidence in my professional brand. They pushed me to see my strengths in communication, resilience, and leadership—skills that are just as critical as technical expertise.</p>
  <p>The workshops with employer partners like Accenture, Fitch, and KPMG have been invaluable. They gave me insights into how tech roles connect to real business problems, and I learned the importance of adaptability, consulting mindsets, and teamwork in large-scale projects. These sessions helped me see that my interests don’t just lie in coding or design, but also in helping businesses use technology strategically.</p>          
      
  <p>Looking ahead, my short-term plan after i.c.stars is to pursue roles like Software Developer or Business Analyst, where I can apply both my technical training and analytical thinking. In the long term, I want to grow into leadership or entrepreneurial roles—eventually starting my own consulting firm that empowers organizations to use technology in innovative ways. My professional brand is rooted in resilience, curiosity, and service. I see myself as someone who bridges the gap between technology and people, using both logic and empathy to solve problems.

Where I was when I started was uncertain but determined. Where I am now is more confident, equipped with skills, and aligned with a purpose. Where I am going is toward a career that combines technology, leadership, and impact—not just building systems, but building solutions that matter.</p>
