            <h2>Leadership</h2>
            <p>Leadership at i.c.stars has been less about titles and more about showing up, stepping up, and learning how to serve others while pushing myself beyond my comfort zone.
                    Team Week was my first real test. I learned quickly that leadership isn’t always about being the loudest voice — it’s about listening, organizing, and making sure the team is moving forward together. My role was to help create structure, keep us aligned with deadlines, and make sure everyone had space to contribute. That week taught me that clarity and encouragement are just as powerful as strategy.
                    During the Gifts Project, I discovered how leadership shows up in creativity and vision. I contributed by bringing new ideas to the table, but also by helping refine our team’s concept so it was practical and impactful. I realized that sometimes the best way to lead is to connect others’ ideas and highlight the strengths already in the room.</p>
                <p> In my Community Role, I took ownership of tasks that supported the whole cohort. Whether it was making sure information flowed clearly or stepping in when something needed attention, I showed leadership by being reliable and proactive. Serving the community taught me that small, consistent actions create trust and credibility.
                    Hosting Tea was another major growth point. Preparing for Tea Guests and engaging with them pushed me to sharpen my communication skills, stay curious, and represent my cohort well. The Tea Debriefs afterward were just as important — they taught me how to reflect, extract lessons from leaders, and apply them to my own journey.</p>

                        <p>Finally, my Dream Speech gave me the opportunity to step into leadership publicly. I was recognized for my vision as a service-oriented leader, and it was powerful to share my story and see how it resonated with others. That moment reminded me that leadership is also about vulnerability — being honest about where you’ve been and where you’re going.

From these experiences, I’ve learned that leadership is not a destination but a daily practice. It means balancing vision with service, speaking with listening, and courage with humility. I plan to take these lessons into every role I step into after i.c.stars, knowing that real leadership starts with how you show up for people, not just projects.</p>
