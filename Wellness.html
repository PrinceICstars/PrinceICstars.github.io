            <h2>Wellness</h2>
            <h3>Financial Wellness</h3>
            <p>Before i.c.stars, my spending patterns were often reactive — buying based on convenience rather than planning. Now, I’ve started tracking my expenses more closely, which helps me see where my money is actually going.
Short-term goals: build an emergency fund with at least 3 months of expenses and pay down small debts.
Long-term goals: increase my credit score to above 750, invest in retirement savings, and eventually buy a home.
If I could give advice to my past self, my financial “do’s and don’ts” would be:
Do: save a portion of every paycheck, even if it’s small.
Do: check your credit score regularly and pay bills on time.
Don’t: ignore budgeting tools — they are free guidance.
Don’t: spend emotionally to solve stress.</p>
<h3>Mental Wellness</h3>
            <p>The intensity of the program tested my ability to focus and manage stress. Early on, I felt burned out trying to balance every task perfectly. What helped me was building a “mental wellness toolbox” that I can carry with me:
Taking short breaks to reset my focus.
Using breathing techniques before presentations or stressful deadlines.
Journaling thoughts at the end of the day to clear my mind.
Listening to focus playlists while working.
Now, instead of being consumed by stress, I use it as a signal to slow down, prioritize, and approach challenges with clarity</p>
<h3>Physical Wellness</h3>
<p>I’ve learned that my body is the foundation of my performance. If I’m not taking care of myself physically, it shows up in my energy, focus, and mood. During the program, I started a simple routine: drinking more water daily, walking 20–30 minutes a few times a week, and making sure I got enough rest to function at my best.
I am my own health advocate now — making time to schedule checkups, choosing healthier meals, and paying attention to my sleep routine. These small choices add up and prepare me for the energy and resilience I’ll need after the internship.</p>
